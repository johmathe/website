= Some software developpment tips

My 10 cents about software developpment.

== C++
  - Use google [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml Coding Standards]. Learn them. Use [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cpplint/cpplint.py Lint] to clean your code.
  - Use a unit testing framework. I recomment [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/ Google Test].
  - I used to hate Eclipse. If you have enough money to get a machine with at least 8GiB of RAM, you should invest some time learning about how to use eclipse. The learning curve is not very steep. I wrote down some very basic [eclipse_tips.html tips about Eclipse].
