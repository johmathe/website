# Tips Flying the bay tour

The bay area is a very busy aviation area in the United states. The main difficulty comes from the three international airports (SFO - San Francisco International, OAK - Oakland International and SJC - San Jose International) arranged in some kind of triangle.

There is a class B airspace centered around SFO, and 2 class C airspaces around.

The general procedure from Palo Alto could be as follow:

  - Request the bay tour from KPAO ground
  - Wait for a Squawk
  - Straigh out departure towards San Carlos (KSQL)
  - Frequency change to KSQL, give altitude
  - Maintain South West of highway 101
  - Frequency change to KSFO, give altitude
  - Wait for the clearance into the class B airspace
  - Once cleared into the class B, follow the highway 101, potentially climb up towards the San Bruno hills
  - Wait for KSFO tower to hand you over to Norcal Departure (slightly different than norcal approach, but still the same TRACON)
  - Once the tour is done over San Francisco City, Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, etc. tell Norcal about the destination (back to KPAO for instance). Wait for their instructions.
